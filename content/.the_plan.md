KubeTrain wants to provide a sustainable and fun initiative for travelling
to KubeCon by train. With our initiative we would like to encourage
KubeCon's participants to consider environmentally-friendly alternatives to
plane travel.

There are two challenges that make people prefer planes over train as main
form of transportation:

💸 Train travel can be **expensive**, at times more expensive than
travelling by plane

🥱 Train travel can take **a long time** for destinations that are further
away

### How do we plan to fix that?

Travelling to KubeCon by train [is not something
new](https://twitter.com/search?q=kubecon%20train&src=typed_query&f=live),
many participants have done it in the past and had an amazing experience
doing it.

Our plan is to rent train carriages (one or more) from different
departure cities to KubeCon. 🚝 Those carriages will be founded by
sponsors that believe in the initiative and participants that would like
to travel to KubeCon by train.

Both sponsors and participants get a great deal out of this initiative:

📌 **Sponsors** will be able to show interest in this sustainable
initiative, distribute their material during the trip and have visibility
throughout the duration of KubeTrain

🙋 **Participants** will be able to buy their train tickets to KubeCon
with a considerable discount and enjoy the trip with activities organized
by the sponsors and the local community.

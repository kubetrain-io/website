Sounds great! We are sure you are going to love it 🎉

## How to participate

Check out the [Departures]({{< relref "/departures" >}}) page and see if
there is already a KubeTrain leaving from your departure. There is one
already? That's great! Follow the info on the dedicated page and you are
ready to go.

**No KubeTrain leaving from your departure?**

Don't desperate, it might come in the future! Reach out to us using the
[About]({{< relref "/about" >}}) page or directly at `{{< cloakemail
"info@kubetrain.io" >}}`. We will let you now in case things change in the
future.

**Maybe you want to kickstart this initiative for your city?**

Head over to the [participate as community]({{< relref
"/participate/as_community" >}}) page and read the instructions over
there.

## What do you get

📌 **A discounted train ticket to KubeCon** - That's what you came here
for, right? 😄

📌 **Plenty of activities during the trip** - Local communities are in
charge of organizing some activities during the trip. A whole carriage
will be reserved to KubeCon's attendees, so nothing is off limits.
Lightning talks, raffles... A hackathon maybe?

📌 **Sustainable travel** - We know that it's not always easy to take the
sustainable alternative when travelling, so we tried to make it as easy as
possible for you to get onboard!

📌 **Networking and Community** - What a better way to get to know the
people that are part of your local community if not travelling with them?

📌 **Access to the KubeTrain party** - We are planning to have a party in
the evening before KubeCon with all the participants of KubeTrain. More
details to come...

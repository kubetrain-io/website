Interested in sponsoring one (or more) of our KubeTrains? 🚝

<!--more-->

Communities organize independently to reach KubeCon from different
departures so, as sponsor, you will have the possibility to participate to
one or more KubeTrains. Those trains are organized by local communities,
since they are the ones that know best their audience and their
participants.

As a sponsor, your role is key to the success to this initiative:

**Providing sustainable and fun travel to KubeCon.**

## How to participate

Head to the [Departures]({{< relref "/departures" >}}) page and find if
there is already a KubeTrain leaving from the departure station that you
would like to sponsor. You will find a way to contact the organizers via
email and they will bring you up to speed in no time.

**The departure you would like to sponsor is not listed?**

Community organizers might still be discussing the details before posting
it online. Reach out to us using the [About]({{< relref "/about" >}}) page
or directly at `{{< cloakemail "info@kubetrain.io" >}}`. We will get back
to you and put you in contact with the right person.

## What do you get

📌 **Visibility and Brand Awareness within your community** - We will make sure
that your company and brand get as much visibility as possible during the
initiative.

📌 **Support of a community initiative** - The local community will recognize
your company as a supporter of this eco-friendly and sustainable initiative. 

📌 **Possibility of distributing your goodies during the trip** - During the
trip you will be able to distribute your goodies and gadgets.

📌 **Some free / discounted tickets for your employees** - As a sponsor you get
some free / discounted tickets for your employees.

📌 **And much more...** - As every community organizes independently, they also
have the possibility to shape custom sponsor deals. Contact them to see what
they have to offer.

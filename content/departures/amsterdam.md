**Planned release**: Late November

We are in contact with Eurostar since they announced that they will resume
[direct trains between Amsterdam and London](https://nltimes.nl/2024/10/31/amsterdam-london-direct-eurostar-train-run-february-200-seats).

Unfortunately, those trains aren't available yet on their platfom, but they will
be soon. We count on opening the sales of those tickets by the end of November.

## What is KubeTrain?

KubeTrain is a sustainable and fun initiative that enables people to travel to KubeCon by train. Our mission is to encourage KubeCon participants to consider environmentally-friendly alternatives to plane travel, making train transportation both affordable and enjoyable.

## How It Started

The idea emerged from recognizing that many KubeCon attendees already travel by train and have amazing experiences doing so. However, two main challenges often discourage people from choosing trains over planes: cost and travel time. KubeTrain was created to address these barriers and make sustainable travel accessible to more of the Kubernetes community.

## What It Means for Attendees

For participants, KubeTrain offers a unique opportunity to:

- **Travel Sustainably**: Reduce your carbon footprint by choosing train travel over flying to KubeCon
- **Save Money**: Purchase train tickets at a considerable discount through our group booking approach
- **Network Early**: Start your KubeCon experience during the journey, connecting with fellow community members
- **Enjoy the Journey**: Participate in activities organized by sponsors and local communities during the trip
- **Experience Something Special**: Be part of a growing movement that combines environmental responsibility with community building

Our approach involves renting entire train carriages from different departure cities to KubeCon, funded by sponsors who believe in sustainable initiatives and participants who want to travel by train. This creates a win-win situation where sponsors gain visibility and can engage with the community, while participants enjoy discounted travel and a memorable experience.

Whether you're looking to reduce your environmental impact, save on travel costs, or simply want to experience KubeCon in a new way, KubeTrain provides a sustainable and community-driven alternative to traditional conference travel.

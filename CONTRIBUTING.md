# Contributing to the Kubetrain Site

The website is based on Hugo so, after you have environment setup,
you can run the local version just by running `hugo serve`.

## Environment setup

### Local setup

Make sure you run with `hugo extended_Hugo 0.125.6`.
This version is old, but this is what is used in the deployment target.

### DevContainers

If you have a Testcontainers-enabled IDE (VSCode, IDEA, etc.),
just switch to the Devcontainer and run hugo in the terminal.

## Deployment

The site is currently deployed to Cloudflare Pages.
